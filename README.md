# 📘 Java Data Structures Course

Welcome to the official repository for the **Java Data Structures Course** – a full hands-on journey into the world of data structures using Java 💻.

This course is designed to **build strong foundations** in data structures through clear explanations, real-world examples, and implementation from scratch. Whether you're a student preparing for university exams, interviews, or just want to master your skills — this is for you!

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- 📦 ArrayList – dynamic arrays and internal logic
- 🔗 LinkedList – singly and doubly linked lists
- 🧱 Stack – LIFO behavior with use cases
- 📬 Queue – FIFO, circular queues, and variations
- 🧮 Recursion – single, double, and backtracking
- 🗃️ HashMap & HashSet – hashing fundamentals
- 🌲 Trees – binary trees, traversals, and BSTs
- 🕸️ Graphs – adjacency list, BFS, DFS, and basic pathfinding
- 🧩 Problem Solving – multiple coding problems for each structure

> 🔧 Each data structure includes:  
> - Full Java implementation from scratch  
> - A `main` class for quick testing  
> - A `Problems` class for common coding exercises
